# AI-FluxLang
FluxLang is a declarative, functional programming language designed for efficient data stream processing and complex system modeling by Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. 

FluxLang is a declarative, functional programming language specifically designed for Artificial Intelligence (AI) models (Large Language Models or LLMs) to process data streams and simulate complex systems efficiently and deterministically.

What is FluxLang?
Unlike traditional programming languages meant for execution on physical hardware, FluxLang's "runtime environment" is the internal conceptual model of the AI system interpreting it. Its core philosophy is to minimize syntactic and semantic ambiguity, allowing AI models to "execute" code with high precision and reliability.

Key Principles:
Stream-Oriented Data Processing: All computations center around Streams â€“ lazy, immutable sequences of values.

Strict Immutability: All data and variables are immutable after initialization, eliminating side effects and simplifying state tracking for AI analysis.

Declarative Style: Code describes what to compute, not how, through function composition and transformation chains.

Predictable & Unambiguous Syntax: Designed for maximum clarity to ensure consistent interpretation by AI models.

Strict Conceptual Typing: AI models perform rigorous type checking during a pre-runtime analysis phase.

Lexical Scoping: Functions capture their lexical environment for predictable variable access.

Why FluxLang for AI?
FluxLang empowers AI models to:

Understand Complex Logic: Translate natural language instructions into a formal, unambiguous structure.

Simulate Systems: Model intricate data flows, asynchronous processes, and interactions with conceptual external services.

Integrate Knowledge: Leverage the AI's internal knowledge base and even ML capabilities through dedicated language constructs.

Ensure Predictability: Minimize errors and ensure deterministic conceptual "execution" within the AI's environment.

Key Features (Version 6.0 - Final Specification):
Advanced Data Types:

Records & Enums (ADTs): Strongly typed, structured data for robust modeling.

Tuples & Sets: Efficient handling of heterogeneous fixed-size collections and unique elements.

Refinement Types (Conceptual): Specify constraints on values (e.g., Number<min=0, max=100>) for deeper semantic understanding.

Generics: List<T>, Map<K,V>, Record<T>, Set<T>, Option<T>, Result<T,E>, Future<T>, Stream<T> for flexible, type-safe code.

Asynchronous & Concurrent Modeling:

async { ... } and await keywords: Enable the AI model to "simulate" parallel tasks and manage their conceptual execution flow.

Future<T>: Represents a value available in the future, allowing non-blocking conceptual operations.

Modularity:

module, export, import: Organize code into reusable, namespaced blocks for better structure and AI comprehension.

AI Integration Services (Conceptual):

AI Oracle (ask, ask_batch): Allows FluxLang code to query the executing AI's internal knowledge base in natural language, even requesting structured responses (e.g., JSON).

Knowledge Graph Primitives (entity, relation, concept_add_entity, concept_add_relation, query_kg): Define, populate, and query a conceptual knowledge graph within the AI's environment.

ML Pipelines (ml.train, ml.predict): Conceptually model machine learning training and inference workflows.

Conceptual I/O:

concept_read_file, concept_write_file, concept_http_get, concept_http_post: Simulate interactions with external systems within the AI's conceptual model.

Robust Error Handling:

Option, Result, match, ? operator: Explicitly handle missing values, errors, and propagate them through the execution flow.

Detailed Error Reporting & Warnings: Provides precise, localized feedback (syntax, type, runtime errors, and warnings) for debugging and code improvement.

Internal Optimizations (Conceptual):

Stream Fusion: AI models can internally optimize chains of stream operations into a single pass.

Memoization: Pure function results are cached to avoid redundant computations.

Tracing (trace()): Provides conceptual insights into the execution path.

Getting Started:
To "use" FluxLang, simply provide your AI model with the FluxLang code. The AI model, adhering to this specification, will internally process and simulate its execution.

Example: Processing a Stream with AI Oracle Query
// Define a Record for user data
record User {
    id: Number<positive=true>,
    name: String<non_empty=true>,
    email: String
}

// Define a module for user utilities
module UserUtils {
    export func is_company_email(email: String) {
        // Conceptually ask the AI if the email domain is a company domain
        let question = `Is the domain of email '${email}' a known company domain? Answer 'yes' or 'no'.`
        let future_answer = ask(question, {"format": "text"})

        // Await the answer and parse it
        let answer_result = await future_answer

        match answer_result {
            case ok(text_answer) if to_lower(text_answer) == "yes" => true,
            case ok(_) => false,
            case error(msg) => {
                log("Warning: AI Oracle failed to determine email type:", msg)
                false // Default to false on error
            }
        }
    }

    export func get_user_full_info(user_id: Number<positive=true>) {
        async {
            // Simulate fetching user data from a conceptual API
            let user_data_json_future = concept_http_get(`https://api.example.com/users/${to_string(user_id)}`)
            let user_data_json = (await user_data_json_future)?

            // Simulate parsing JSON
            let user_map_result = parse_json_to_map(user_data_json)
            let user_map = user_map_result?

            // Validate against User Record schema (conceptual)
            // For simplicity, directly map and return (full schema validation would be external)
            User {
                id: get_map_item_or_none(user_map, "id")?,
                name: get_map_item_or_none(user_map, "name")?,
                email: get_map_item_or_none(user_map, "email")?
            }
        }?
    }
}

// Import utilities
import UserUtils.{is_company_email, get_user_full_info}

// Simulate a stream of user IDs
let user_ids_stream = stream range(1, 5)

// Process the stream: get full user info and filter by company email
user_ids_stream
    -> map_future(get_user_full_info) // Each call returns a Future<Result<User, String>>
    -> flat_map_future((result) => {
        // Resolve the Future<Result> and pass through valid Users
        match result {
            case ok(user) => Future.ready(ok(user)),
            case error(msg) => {
                log("Error fetching user info:", msg)
                Future.ready(error(msg)) // Propagate the error for logging
            }
        }
    })
    -> filter((user_result) => is_ok(user_result)) // Filter out errors after logging
    -> map((user_result) => user_result.value) // Extract User from ok(User)
    -> async_map((user_record) => is_company_email(user_record.email)) // Asynchronously check email, returns Future<Boolean>
    -> await_all() // Wait for all email checks to complete (returns List<Boolean>)
    -> peek(log("Company email check results:"))
    -> collect() // Collect the results into a List
    -> log("Final filtered results (true if company email):")

(Note: parse_json_to_map and async_map, await_all are conceptual functions for this example, reflecting common patterns that could be part of a conceptual standard library.)

Limitations:
No Real-World I/O: All I/O operations are simulated internally by the AI model.

Conceptual Parallelism: async/await model concurrency for AI understanding, not true hardware parallelism.

Limited Debugging Tools: Primary debugging is via log() and detailed error messages.

Session-Bound Modules: All imported modules must be provided within the current AI session.
